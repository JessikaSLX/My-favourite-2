    <p> My favorite Hobby is Digital Art, it's just like drawing with paper and pencil but Digitally.
         I like doing Digital Art as it has lots of brush and I don't need to ask my parents to buy me new brushes, 
         the app itself has lots of brush that I can use!

      <br> <br>

    I normally use the app called "Ibis Paint" it has lots of readymade backgrounds, 
    effects etc so it's easy for me to use it

    <br> <br>

      I started making Digital arts when I was in 5th, I find it really intresting cause when I'm sad I make Digital
       arts I express my sadness, happiness, anger etc by making a character or some background, it helps a lot,
        it's really calming and I even improve my drawing skills through it!
